# Noise2Average-startcode
Keras implementation for Noise2Average. Here we provide the startcode of Noise2Average and simulation data for running the Noise2Average. As shown in our paper in reference, Noise2Average can be also applied in denoising diffusion data and has superior performance in denoising empirical data where <font color=red>**the misalignment cannot be ignored.**</font> 

In this repository, we <font color=red>**only provide well-aligned images**</font>, which were generated by adding gaussian noise to the phantom of Brainweb. Therefore, Noise2Noise can outperform Noise2Average and this phenomenon has been reported and disscussed in our ISMRM 2022 paper^[Zihan Li, Berkin Bilgic, Ziyu Li, Kui Ying, Jonathan R. Polimeni, Susie Huang, and Qiyuan Tian, Noise2Average: deep learning based denoising without high-SNR training data using iterative residual learning, The 2022 Annual Scientific Meeting of ISMRM.]. To figure out how Noise2Average works in empirical data, please use your own dataset or refer to the data availability.

**Fig1. Learning strategies.** Learning strategies of supervised (a), Noise2Noise (b) and Noise2Average (c) denoising are illustrated for the case of two repetitions of noisy images. Supervised denoising trains a CNN to map the average of the two noisy images to its residual image compared to the ground-truth image with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (a). Noise2Noise trains a CNN to map one noisy image to the other noisy image (b). Noise2Average performs supervised residual learning iteratively, with the training target as the average of the two noisy images with slightly higher SNR for iteration 1, and the average of denoised images from iteration _i_-1 for iteration _i_ (_i_ = 2, 3, 4, …) (c).

**Fig2. Convolutional neural networks.** 3D modified U-Nets (MU-Nets) excluding pooling and up-sampling layers are adopted in this study. For denoising T1-weighted images at higher spatial resolution, a deeper MU-Net (18 layers) with a larger receptive field is employed (a), with 64 channels at intermediate layers. For denoising diffusion images at lower resolution but with much more image channels, a slightly shallower MU-Net (10 layers) is employed, with 192 channels at intermediate layers and batch normalization before every 3D convolution layer.
